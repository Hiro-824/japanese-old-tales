## The Miraculous Peach

Long, long ago, there lived a kind old man and an old woman. The man would go to the mountains every day to cut wood, and the woman would go to the river to wash clothes. They were happy, but for one thing: they had no children of their own, and they prayed for one every day.

One morning, as the old woman was washing clothes, she saw a magnificent sight. A gigantic peach, bigger than any she had ever seen, came floating down the river, bobbing gently in the current.

> What a wonderful gift from the heavens! 

she exclaimed.

Carefully, she guided the enormous peach to the shore and, with great effort, carried it home to her husband. That evening, when the old man returned, he was astonished.

> Let's eat it! 

he said. 

> It must be as delicious as it is big.

But as the old man raised his knife to cut the peach, it split open on its own. And from inside, to their utter amazement, emerged a healthy, crying baby boy!

The baby looked at them and spoke with a voice as clear as a bell.

> Do not be afraid. The gods have sent me to you, to be the son you have always wished for.

The old man and woman wept with joy. They named him **Momotaro**, which means Peach Boy, and they raised him with all the love in their hearts.

Momotaro was no ordinary child. He grew strong and brave, and ate twice as much as any other boy his age. By the time he was five, he could chop down a large tree with a small, old knife. He grew into a fine young man, respected and loved by all in his village.

## The Quest to Demon Island

One day, news came that a band of fearsome *Oni*—horned demons or ogres—had been terrorizing the land. They lived in a fortress on a distant island called Onigashima, or Demon Island, and they would sail to the coast to raid villages and steal their treasures.

Hearing this, Momotaro went to his parents with a determined look in his eye.

> Mother, Father, 

he said, 

> I am strong enough now. I will go to Onigashima and defeat these Oni once and for all. Please, make me some of the best millet dumplings in Japan for my journey.

His parents were worried, but they knew he was doing a brave and noble thing. They were filled with pride. They gave him a fine sword and a pouch filled with delicious *kibi dango* (millet dumplings). Waving goodbye, Momotaro set off on his quest.

## The Three Companions

On his way to the coast, Momotaro met a stray dog. The dog barked fiercely.

> Where are you going, Momotaro? 

the dog growled. 

> And what is that you have in your pouch?

> I am going to defeat the Oni on Demon Island, 

Momotaro replied calmly. 

> And in this pouch, I have the best millet dumplings in all of Japan.

> Give me one, 

said the dog, 

>and I will come with you.

Momotaro gave the dog a dumpling. The dog ate it and wagged its tail, its loyalty won forever.

Continuing on, they met a monkey swinging in the trees.

> Greetings, Momotaro! 

the monkey chattered. 

> That smells delicious. Spare one of your famous dumplings, and I will join your quest.

Momotaro shared a dumpling with the monkey, who gratefully joined his side.

Finally, as they neared the sea, a magnificent pheasant flew down and landed before them.

> I have heard of your quest, brave Momotaro, 

said the pheasant. 

> Give me a dumpling, and my sharp eyes and strong wings will serve you well.

Momotaro gave the pheasant a dumpling. Now, with his three loyal friends—the Dog, the Monkey, and the Pheasant—by his side, he was ready.

## The Battle on Demon Island

They sailed across the sea and soon saw the dark shores of Onigashima. Before them stood a fearsome fortress with towering iron gates, guarded by several Oni.

Momotaro and his friends made a plan.
*   The **Pheasant** flew over the wall, swooping down to peck at the guards’ eyes.
*   While the guards were distracted, the clever **Monkey** scaled the fortress wall and unlocked the great gate from the inside.
*   The gate swung open, and the fierce **Dog** rushed in, biting and tearing at the legs of the startled Oni.

Then, with a mighty battle cry, **Momotaro** charged in, his sword flashing. The Oni were strong, but they were no match for the teamwork of Momotaro and his animal companions. They fought their way to the center of the fortress, where they confronted the Oni chief.

The chief was a massive, terrifying demon, but Momotaro fought bravely, and with the help of his friends, he brought the giant to his knees.

> We surrender! 

the chief roared. 

> We will give back all the treasure we have stolen. Please, spare our lives!

Momotaro accepted their surrender. He and his friends loaded carts with the plundered gold, silver, and precious jewels. With the Oni chief as their captive to ensure the promise was kept, they sailed back home in triumph.

Momotaro returned to his village a hero. He gave the treasure back to the people, and his proud parents welcomed him home with tears of joy. The land was safe, and Momotaro, his parents, and his three loyal animal friends lived together in peace and happiness for the rest of their days.
