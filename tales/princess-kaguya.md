## Prologue: The Birth of Princess Kaguya

Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo cutter and his wife. The old man, whose name was Sanuki no Miyatsuko, made his living gathering bamboo to be used for all sorts of things.

One day, as the old man went into the bamboo grove, he came upon a stalk that was glowing with a brilliant light. Puzzled, he drew closer and looked inside. There, he found a tiny, lovely girl, only about three inches tall. The old man and his wife decided to raise her as their own child, for they had none.

After that day, the old man often found gold inside the bamboo stalks he cut, and he and his wife soon became very wealthy. The child they had found grew astonishingly fast, and in just three months, she had become a beautiful young lady. They held a ceremony to tie up her hair for the first time and dressed her in fine robes.

Her beauty was otherworldly, so much so that her presence filled their home with light, leaving no corner in darkness. Whenever the old man felt his heart ache with sadness or worry, he had only to look at his daughter, and his troubles would vanish.

Because she had grown so wonderfully, they sought out a wise man named Mimurodo Imube no Akita to give her a proper name. He named her **Nayotake no Kaguya-hime**, "the Shining Princess of the Supple Bamboo." To celebrate, they held a grand feast for three days, filled with poetry, music, and dancing.

## The Impossible Tasks of the Five Nobles

Word of Princess Kaguya's beauty spread, and men from all walks of life, rich and poor, fell in love with her from mere rumor alone. Countless young nobles began to linger around the old bamboo cutter's house, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. They would stay up all night, pacing outside the gates and digging holes in the fence to peer through, even though no one, not even those inside the house, could easily see her.

Eventually, most gave up. Only five persistent nobles, all famous for their romantic passions, remained. They came to her house day and night, refusing to be turned away. These five were Prince Ishitsukuri, Prince Kuramochi, the Minister of the Right Abe no Mimuraji, the Grand Counselor Otomo no Miyuki, and the Middle Counselor Isonokami no Maro.

Seeing this, the old man spoke to Kaguya.

> "My dear child, who is as precious to me as a Buddha. I am now seventy, and I do not know if I will be here tomorrow. In this world, men and women marry. You cannot remain this way forever."

Princess Kaguya replied:

> "But I do not wish to marry someone whose heart I do not truly know. If he were unfaithful, I would be filled with regret. Please tell the nobles this: I will serve the man who can bring me what I desire. Announce to them the challenges I have set."

That night, when the five nobles gathered, the old man relayed Kaguya's message. She had set an impossible task for each of them.

*   **For Prince Ishitsukuri:** The stone begging bowl of the Buddha.
*   **For Prince Kuramochi:** A jeweled branch from the mythical island of Horai—one with a root of silver, a stem of gold, and fruits of pearl.
*   **For the Minister Abe:** The legendary robe of the fire-rat, a cloth that will not burn.
*   **For the Counselor Otomo:** The five-colored jewel from the neck of a dragon.
*   **For the Counselor Isonokami:** A cowrie shell said to be born from a swallow.

Each of these was a treasure known only in legend, impossible to obtain.

**Prince Ishitsukuri** simply took a common, soot-stained bowl from a mountain temple and presented it as the Buddha's. Kaguya saw through the lie at once, as the legendary bowl was said to glow with a holy light, and his did not.

**Prince Kuramochi** hired the finest craftsmen to forge a breathtakingly beautiful replica of the jeweled branch. He presented it to Kaguya, but just as she was being convinced, the craftsmen arrived, demanding to be paid for their work. His deception was revealed.

**The Minister Abe** purchased what a merchant from China claimed was the fire-rat's robe for a great sum of money. When Kaguya tested it by putting it in the fire, however, it burned to ashes instantly.

**The Counselor Otomo** set out on a ship to find the dragon. He was caught in a terrible storm that nearly killed him, and he returned sick and defeated, having failed completely.

**The Counselor Isonokami** climbed to the roof of a great storehouse where swallows were nesting. Reaching into a nest, he thought he had grabbed the shell, but he lost his footing and fell, breaking his hip. What he held in his hand was not a cowrie shell, but an old, dry swallow's dropping. He fell ill from his injury and shame.

When Kaguya heard the Counselor was on his deathbed, she sent a poem of consolation. He managed to write a reply before he died. Hearing this, Kaguya felt a pang of pity for him. In the end, not a single one of the nobles could complete her tasks.

## The Emperor's Proposal

The story of Princess Kaguya and her impossible tasks eventually reached the Emperor himself. Intrigued, he sent a messenger to see her, but Kaguya refused to meet him.

The Emperor then summoned the old bamboo cutter and offered him a court rank if he would present Kaguya. Though the old man was overjoyed and pleaded with her, Kaguya remained firm.

> "Even if it is the Emperor who summons me, I will not go. If you try to force me, I will simply disappear."

Undeterred, the Emperor devised a plan. He announced he was going on a royal hunt and used it as a pretext to visit the bamboo cutter’s house. He burst inside and saw a figure sitting in a room filled with light. It was Kaguya. Struck by her unearthly beauty, he tried to bring her to his palanquin to take her back to the palace.

But as he reached for her, her body dissolved into a mere shadow of light. At that moment, the Emperor understood she was not a mortal woman. Overcome with longing, he left, feeling as if he had left his very soul behind.

From that day on, he could think of no one but her. All the court ladies he once found beautiful now seemed plain. He spent his days in solitude, exchanging letters and poems with Princess Kaguya.

## Return to the Moon

Three years passed in this way. Then, one spring, Princess Kaguya began to gaze at the moon with a look of deep sorrow. As the full moon of the eighth month approached, she began to weep uncontrollably.

Worried, the old man asked her what was wrong. She finally confessed:

> "I am not of this world. I am from the Capital of the Moon, and on the fifteenth of this month, I must return. I was sent here for only a short time, but so many years have passed. I cannot stay, even though it breaks my heart to leave you."

The Emperor was informed of this and, at the old man's request, sent two thousand soldiers to guard the house. On the night of the fifteenth, a thousand men stood on the roof, and a thousand stood on the ground. The old woman held Kaguya in her arms inside a windowless store-room, and the old man stood guard at the locked door.

Kaguya told them:

> "It is no use. You cannot fight the people of my land. Their weapons are not of this world. When they arrive, every locked door will open on its own."

And so it happened. Around midnight, the area around the house lit up as bright as day. Beings descended from the sky, riding on clouds, and hovered about five feet off the ground. The soldiers were seized with a strange terror; all the fight went out of them. Their arms grew weak, and they could not even draw their bows.

A man who appeared to be their king called out, "Miyatsuko, come forth!" The old man, who had been so defiant, suddenly felt weak and fell to the ground. The king spoke:

> "You have performed a small good deed, and as a reward, we sent the princess to you for a short time. With the gold she brought, you have become rich. Princess Kaguya was sent here as punishment for a crime she committed. Now her time is done. Release her."

The old man refused to obey. A flying chariot was brought near the house. "Come, Princess Kaguya," the king said. "Why would you linger in such a defiled place?"

Instantly, all the locked doors flew open. Kaguya floated out of the old woman's arms and toward the chariot.

Crying, she tried to comfort her parents, writing a final farewell letter. A celestial being offered her a box containing the **Celestial Robe of Feathers** and another with the **Elixir of Immortality**. As another being offered her the elixir, Kaguya took a small taste. Just as they were about to place the robe on her, she stopped them to write one last letter to the Emperor. In it was a poem:

> Now, as I must go
> and don this celestial robe,
> my heart fills with sorrow
> as I think of you,
> my Lord.

She gave the letter and the remaining elixir to an officer to deliver to the Emperor. The moment the officer took it, the celestial beings draped the Robe of Feathers over her shoulders. Instantly, all of her love and sorrow for the world vanished. All human memories and attachments were gone.

Princess Kaguya stepped into the flying chariot and ascended back to the moon.

## Epilogue: The Origin of Mount Fuji

The Emperor read Kaguya's letter and was overcome with a grief so profound he could no longer eat or enjoy music. He summoned his advisors and asked:

> "Which mountain is the closest to Heaven?"

An advisor told him of a great mountain in the province of Suruga. (This is **Mount Fuji**, the highest mountain in Japan.)

The Emperor composed a final poem, lamenting that without Kaguya, the elixir of immortality was meaningless to him. He then commanded his men to take Kaguya's letter and the elixir to the summit of that mountain and burn them.

It is said that because the Emperor sent a great number of warriors, or **tsuwamono**, to that mountain, it came to be known as **Fuji no Yama** (The Mountain of Warriors). Others say its name comes from the elixir of **fushi** (immortality) that was burned there.

The legend says that the smoke from that fire still rises from the mountain's peak and drifts among the clouds to this day.
